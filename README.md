## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this social proof section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
I can use any tools you like to help me complete the challenge.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

## My process

I adopted a mobile-first approach and built in all of the key elements using flexbox. From there, I gradually added standardised breakpoints to ensure that all of the elements responded correctly to varying screen sizes, and to produce an appealing result.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- B.E.M Methodology


### What I learned

I learned how to effectively use breakpoints at varying screen sizes as well as applying and controlling multiple decorative background images on a web page contained within a single class.


### Continued development

My next area of focus will be CSS Grid and using this as the main layout tool for the next project.
